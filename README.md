LangChain API

## Setup
Make sure you install python before (in case you don't have it)

Create a python env for installing/running the FastAPI Api. If you are a python developer, conda or miniconda is recommended, but if you only need that setup for this app, then just setup an environment directly with python as follows:

```
python -m venv env
source ./env/bin/activate
```

install packages with:
```
(env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
